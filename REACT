'''
The code below is the result of practice problems in Data Camp for LLM Agentic Design -- learning Agents and REACT 
'''
# Create the agent
app = create_react_agent(model=model, tools=[count_r_in_word])

# Create a query
query = "How many r's are in the word 'Terrarium'?"

# Invoke the agent and store the response
response = app.invoke({"messages": [("human", query)]})

# Print the agent's response
print(response['messages'][-1].content)
'''
For the Above problem, tool, ChatOpenAI, create_react_agent, math, and model were loaded already asd well as the tool "count_r_in_word"
